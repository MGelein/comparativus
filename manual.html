            </a>1. Basic Usage</h2>
        <p>In this chapter will briefly explain the basic usage of
            <em>Comparativus</em>. As such this chapter can best be seen as a quick start guide. First we will run through the
            selection of files and different methods of providing
            <em>Comparativus</em> with files to compare. After that we will take a look at how you run an actual comparison.
            This will be followed by a description of the review and selection process of the results. Finally we will talk
            about how you can download the results of your comparison for visualization or further analysis using your own
            solutions.</p>
        <h3 id="i-selecting-files">
            <a class="anchor" name="i-selecting-files" href="#i-selecting-files">
                <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
            </a>i. Selecting Files</h3>
        <p>Before you can compare files using
            <em>Comparativus</em> you first need to tell the program what files you want to be compared. As of April 2018 only
            comparison of two files at a time is possible, although multifile comparison is a planned feature. To select
            files you have the following options:</p>
        <h4 id="markus-file-management">
            <a class="anchor" name="markus-file-management" href="#markus-file-management">
                <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
            </a>MARKUS File Management</h4>
        <p>Supply two files using the
            <em>MARKUS</em> file management. (
            <a href="http://dh.chinese-empires.eu/MARKUS/beta/fileManagement.html">link</a>).</p>
        <p>
            <img style="max-width: 70%;" src="gif/selectmarkus.gif">
        </p>
        <h4 id="comparativus-file-selection">
            <a class="anchor" name="comparativus-file-selection" href="#comparativus-file-selection">
                <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
            </a>Comparativus File Selection</h4>
        <p>Directly navigate to
            <em>Comparativus</em> and select two files from the file selection menu that will appear. (
            <a href="http://dh.chinese-empires.eu/comparativus">link</a>).</p>
        <p>
            <img style="max-width: 70%;" src="gif/selectcomparativus.gif">
        </p>
        <p>Once you have two files selected and loaded you will see them in your screen in a tabbed window as shown in this
            image:</p>
        <p>
            <img style="max-width: 70%;" src="gif/tabs.jpg">
        </p>
        <p>Clicking on either tab will switch the text overview to that specific text allowing you to read through the text.</p>
        <h3 id="ii-running-a-comparison">
            <a class="anchor" name="ii-running-a-comparison" href="#ii-running-a-comparison">
                <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
            </a>ii. Running a Comparison</h3>
        <p>With two files loaded you are now ready to start a comparison between these texts. This is very simply done by clicking
            the "Compare Texts" button in the top right of the screen, as shown below:</p>
        <p>
            <img style="max-width: 70%;" src="gif/startcomparison.gif">
        </p>
        <h3 id="iii-viewing-selecting-results">
            <a class="anchor" name="iii-viewing-selecting-results" href="#iii-viewing-selecting-results">
                <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
            </a>iii. Viewing &amp; Selecting Results</h3>
        <p>Once you have run a comparison you will now have results, although that may not yet be immediately clear to you.
            This is the moment to start talking about
            <em>pages</em>. Along the top of the screen you will see the following three buttons grouped together:</p>
        <p>
            <img style="max-width: 70%;" src="gif/pages.jpg">
        </p>
        <p>These buttons take you to the appropriate page to view the comparison in that perspective. A quick rundown of the
            pages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Text</strong>: This is the default page. On this page you can see the texts that have been loaded and can
                browse through them.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Table</strong>: This page will show you the results of your comparison, after it's done ofcourse, in a table
                view providing you with a quantitive view of the data.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Visualisation</strong>: This page will show you a visual representation of the results of your comparison.
                </li>
        </ul>
        <p>On
            <strong>any</strong> of these pages you can select and view your results although the ease of selection and reviewing
            of results may differ per page. To include a result, also called a match, in your selection you simply click
            it once. To de-select it you can click it again. Selecting and deselecting of a result in the
            <em>Table</em> page is shown below:</p>
        <p>
            <img style="max-width: 70%;" src="gif/selecttable.gif">
        </p>
        <p>Once you have a specific result selected, that same result is now shown as selected on all other pages as well. For
            example: If you select multiple entries on the table page you can now also see these results highlighted on the
            visualisation and text page.</p>
        <p>Another helpful tool in reviewing your selection is the collapsible selection overview. Using this screen you can
            quickly navigate your selected results and go to the specified page by clicking the corresponding button:</p>
        <p>
            <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="gif/showselection.gif">
        </p>
        <h3 id="iv-downloading-saving-results">
            <a class="anchor" name="iv-downloading-saving-results" href="#iv-downloading-saving-results">
                <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
            </a>iv. Downloading &amp; Saving Results</h3>
        <p>Maybe dedicated visualisation or analysis software can provide a deeper insight into the data you just created. Or
            maybe you just want to download the results of your comparison for future reference. Whatever the reason may
            be, you can always download your comparison results onto your local computer using the download buttons shown
            below:</p>
        <p>
            <img style="max-width: 70%;" src="gif/download.jpg">
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Download as TSV:</strong> This will download either all the data (if no selection has been made) or a selection
                of the data in a
                <code>.tsv</code> file to your local harddrive. For more info on TSV:
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values">info</a>.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Download as JSON:</strong> This will download either all the data (if no selection has been made) or a selection
                of the data in a
                <code>.json</code> file to your local harddrive. For more info on JSON:
                <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">info</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Alternatively you might want to save the results of your comparison back into the original
            <em>MARKUS</em> document you have been working on. To use this feature you must first create a selection of results
            you want to save back into both the
            <em>MARKUS</em> documents. You do this using the mechanics described in the previous sub-chapter 'Viewing &amp; Selecting
            Results'. </p>
        <p>Once you have a selection ready to be saved into your
            <em>MARKUS</em> document you press the 'Save Selection to MARKUS' button:</p>
        <p>
            <img style="max-width: 70%;" src="gif/savetoMARKUS.gif">
        </p>
        <p>Your results will now be saved into the original
            <em>MARKUS</em> document you have been working on. If you have made it this far you now know enough about the usage
            of
            <em>Comparativus</em> to be able to work with it. In the following chapter we will discuss the tweaking of comparison
            parameters.</p>
        <h2 id="2-comparison-parameters">
            <a class="anchor" name="2-comparison-parameters" href="#2-comparison-parameters">
                <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
            </a>2. Comparison Parameters</h2>
        <p>The default parameters for comparison seem to work fine for most use cases but sometimes you might want to change
            the parameters of the comparison to get better results. In the following, very short, subchapters we will briefly
            go through every setting found in the 'Comparison Settings' menu found in the top right of your screen.</p>
        <p>
            <img style="max-width: 90%;" src="gif/comparisonsettings.jpg">
        </p>
        <h3 id="i-minimum-match-size">
            <a class="anchor" name="i-minimum-match-size" href="#i-minimum-match-size">
                <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
            </a>i. Minimum Match Size</h3>
        <p>Out of all the parameters this is easily the one parameter that holds the most power over the results that will show
            up from your comparison. This is essentialy a minimum length any match must be to be considered to be added to
            the results list. Lowering this setting will generally give you more results. </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Watch Out:</strong> Lowering this settings too much
            <strong>will</strong> make your browser crash. The lower boundary for this setting is mostly language dependent, but
            carefully consider what the shortest
            <em>meaningful</em> result might be and adjust accordingly. The default (7) seems to be a sweet spot for all Classical
            Chinese test cases used in development. </p>
        <h3 id="ii-ignore-whitespace">
            <a class="anchor" name="ii-ignore-whitespace" href="#ii-ignore-whitespace">
                <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
            </a>ii. Ignore Whitespace</h3>
        <p>During development we quickly found out that whitespace can create many false positives in your matches especially
            considering the fact that most of the whitespace encountered in digital texts has been added at a later date
            and thus is not semantically significant. Therefore we remove all whitespace from a text during the comparison
            and add it back in after the comparison is done. If you work with texts that
            <strong>do</strong> have semantically significant whitespace you can set this parameter to 'No, keep all whitespace'.
            </p>
        <p>
            <em>The following characters are considered whitespace: linebreak, carriage return, space, non breaking space and
                tab.</em>
        </p>
        <h3 id="iii-ignore-punctuation">
            <a class="anchor" name="iii-ignore-punctuation" href="#iii-ignore-punctuation">
                <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
            </a>iii. Ignore Punctuation</h3>
        <p>Shortly after we found out that whitespace created false positives in our results we found the same to be true for
            punctuation. Once again most of this has been added at a later date, sometimes even by a modern editor. As such
            it seemed best to, by default, ignore any punctuation during comparison. If your specific text has semantically
            significant punctuation you can set this parameter to 'No, keep all punctuation' to take punctuation into account
            during comparison.</p>
        <p>
