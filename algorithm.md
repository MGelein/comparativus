# Comparativus Algorithm
In this file I will try to explain the comparison algorithm used in *Comparativus* in detail following the comparison process step by step. But before we begin I would like to include a bit of history of *Comparativus* and its *raison d'Ãªtre*. 

## Comparativus History
In december 2016 I started working on a comparison module for the already succesful online text editing and annotating environment *MARKUS*. The initial development stage was mostly plagued by unfamiliarity with cross-browser compatability and methods used for text comparison. This stage took roughly the first half year and was mostly filled with experimentation with different algorithms and Javascript technologies. The real breakthrough came when in the first half of
